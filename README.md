# Helping Hand

Mental health has got to be one of the biggest topics in today's times.  In this project I tried to tackle mental health issues by creating an application which allows
for the people of Zimbabwe to post whatever they are going through and be able to get help from others.
People can post this anonymously which is a benefit because they do not get to be judged.  
This is a simple blog application and I created it using Python's Django framework as the backend.

## What I learnt:

- working with Django to create web applications
- working with Django in production and setting up static files
